In the journalism world, they have these weird concepts called &#8220;sources&#8221; and &#8220;quotes.&#8221; And you have to &#8220;attribute&#8221; everything.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m in the middle of a paper on concussions in high school athletics. You wouldn&#8217;t believe it, but Athletic Directors aren&#8217;t exactly excited to talk to me about it. I&#8217;ve talked to nearly 20 sources: players, trainers, organizations, ADs, doctors, MIAA, and the Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>&#8230;Now I have to write it.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t care about any of this. I&#8217;m just giving you heads up to why this will be the shortest Media Musings column ever.<span id="more-218"></span></p>
<h2>Am I Being To Tough On &#8216;Em?</h2>
<blockquote><p><s><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GreshandZo" rel="nofollow">@</a></s><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GreshandZo" rel="nofollow">GreshandZo</a>: </strong>And you waste no time being wrong dickhead RT <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/KenAlofoque" rel="nofollow"><s>@</s><strong>KenAlofoque</strong></a>:<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GreshandZo" rel="nofollow"><s>@</s><strong>GreshandZo</strong></a> jeezz fatboy you waste no time with the speculation&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some personalities in the local media I crush more than others. As much as I enjoy finding holes in work or flawed logic, part of me feels bad.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Gresh</strong> doesn&#8217;t get any of this sympathy.</p>
<p>Gresh came into my life as the &#8220;matter-of-fact&#8221; guy on Patriot broadcasts. Once a week was the perfect dosage of Gresh. In fact, to this day, I like him on that show.</p>
<p>I never listened to the Providence incarceration of &#8220;Gresh &amp; Zo&#8221;; therefore, when Gresh took over for <strong>Gary</strong> <strong>Tanguay</strong> at &#8220;The Sports Hub&#8221; I was intrigued.</p>
<p>I was also ignorant.</p>
<p>There is no way &#8220;Gresh &amp; Zo&#8221; survive if &#8220;Dale &amp; Holley&#8221; never disbanded, am I right? Is that a tipping point?</p>
<p>&#8220;Gresh &amp; Zo&#8221; are dominant in the midday. There is no disputing this fact. But they are becoming insufferable. Look, I think every personality over at &#8220;The Sports Hub&#8221; feels great right now. They&#8217;ve taken down the institution that was sports talk radio here in Boston&#8230;.for the time being.</p>
<p>Although, &#8220;Gresh &amp; Zo&#8221; seem to represent much of what consumers criticized about WEEI. (Condescending attitudes, Dumb bits [their &#8216;Instant Request&#8217; segment is a woeful attempt at capturing &#8220;Toucher &amp; Rich&#8221; magic], Talking-head attitude &#8212; &#8220;We&#8217;ll tell you why..next!&#8221;)</p>
<p>This is not as much an assault on <strong>Scott Zolak</strong>, as it is Gresh. Zolak enables Gresh to act the way he does by NEVER disagreeing with any bite or vehemence.</p>
<p>*Side note: Furthermore, the exchange on Twitter isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;m going to harp on in terms of &#8220;Gresh&#8217;s professionalism&#8221; (which I&#8217;ve attacked before). Gresh calling someone a &#8220;dickhead&#8221; on Twitter, illustrates his lack of awareness. I can&#8217;t call professionalism into question &#8212; <strong>Fred Toettcher</strong> has the same exchanges from time to time. That said, it looks bad. A random dude calling you &#8220;fat&#8221; should elicit a reaction, but not necessarily a response. Know your platform. I digress.</p>
<p>Anyway, something tells me, you&#8217;ll see less discrepancy across the board in the Fall ratings book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mut &amp; Merloni&#8221; are <em>improving. </em>Guests are getting better, chemistry is developing, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever rooted harder for two guys to do well. Earlier this week they landed <strong>Adrian Wojnarowski</strong> &#8211; who is absolutely CRUSHING IT on the NBA beat for Yahoo! Sports &#8211; and <strong>John Farrell</strong> within the same hour of programming.</p>
<h2>Quick Musings</h2>
<p>1.) <strong>Michael Holley</strong> &amp; <strong>Michael Felger</strong> on <em>Sports Tonight </em>together? Break up the band! By far the best combo CSNNE has to offer to host the show. Great stuff last night.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>Tony Massarotti</strong> has been a respected sports writer in this town for 20 years. Yet, everyday, his &#8220;take&#8221; is that &#8220;____ SUCKKSSS, Mike! And it&#8217;s NOT EVER CLOSE!&#8221; Did he catch wind, his incessant &#8220;YARM-ing&#8221; (You&#8217;re Absolutely Right, Mike) was over-the-top and called an audible?</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Ian Rapoport</strong> delivers a great column on <strong><a href="http://bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?&amp;articleid=1387057&amp;format=&amp;page=1&amp;listingType=pats#articleFull" target="_blank">Antwaun Molden</a></strong>. Great profile piece.</p>
<p>4.) <strong>Kirk Minihane</strong> does well to show both sides of the <a href="http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/hockey/bruins/kirk-minihane/2011/12/07/time-tyler-seguin-grow" target="_blank"><strong>Tyler Seguin</strong> benching</a>, but ultimately says, &#8220;Your either a professional athlete or you aren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>5.) COLUMN OF THE WEEK: <strong>Chuck Klosterman&#8217;s </strong><a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7319858/the-people-hate-tim-tebow" target="_blank">extensive look at the <strong>Tim Tebow</strong> craze.</a> Voluminous&#8230;For sure. Awesome piece, though.</p>
<p>This should be in the next <em>Grantland Quarterly. </em>Remember last week, when I criticized the book&#8217;s existence? Well one of the reasons, according to <strong>Bill Simmons</strong>, was to capture what the period in sports <em>meant. </em>Tebow, like it or not, is one of the biggest stories in sports right now.</p>

I believe that. I really do.</p>
<p>On his podcast with <strong>Chuck Klosterman</strong>, before his best-selling tome <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Book of Basketball</span> was released,  Simmons rationalized the 700 page length saying, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to split it up into two volumes. I hate making people pay for my stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>This made the Sports Guy&#8217;s <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7273795/the-sports-guy-thanksgiving-picks" target="_blank">column last Thursday</a> that much more compelling. The first half of the piece detailed reasons why the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Grantland Quarterly</span>, um, exists and also, um, why you should buy it!</p>
<p>Perplexing.<span id="more-209"></span></p>
<p>The book, essentially, is a cumulative collection of Grantland pieces. Almost like a &#8220;Best Of&#8221; from the first three months of the site&#8217;s existence. Of course this can all be had by clicking on the Grantland archives, but that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Here are the five reasons given why this even exists &#8212;</p>
<p>1.) Simmons wanted to have something physical to exist in case the internet blew up (he joked). He admits having something tangible is a completely selfish reason. Okay, then.</p>
<p>2.) The book&#8217;s goal is capturing &#8216;the period&#8217; in sports history. What he actually means is reading the pieces and remembering what that period <em>meant. </em>Though, when talking about this in detail, Simmons recalls the struggles of writing around two lockouts, being understaffed, and trying to launch the site. Where does the consumer come in? Are we supposed to have our own thoughts on Grantland&#8217;s oral history on the <em>National? </em>Because I don&#8217;t have an emotional connection to that piece besides, maybe, &#8216;This is interesting.&#8217;</p>
<p>3.) Probably the only consumer-based reason: Re-inventing the product to book form (to take on the beach or vacation with you) and also adding small retrospective changes to the columns.</p>
<p>4.) From most logical to most self-serving, Simmons talks about creating the collection for his father. I don&#8217;t really have anything to say besides, &#8220;Put it in a card, dude.&#8221;</p>
<p>5.) Finally, Simmons gives a pitch on why the quarterly is a great buy and an even better gift!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you give the <em>Quarterly </em>out as a holiday present to someone who doesn&#8217;t know Grantland, they&#8217;ll open it, feel the cover, see the drawings and special wrinkles and think, <em>My God, you shouldn&#8217;t have!!!!!</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em></em>Then, Simmons went <em>there. </em>The &#8220;Exclusive Club&#8221; sales pitch route&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>We printed a relatively small number of them; once they&#8217;re gone, they&#8217;re gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simmons, who is the earliest benefactor of the Internet age in sports journalism, portrays himself as a man of the people. He writes from a fan&#8217;s perspective. Even through his prolific success, the Sports Guy has maintained that voice. He is conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>(The bitter blogosphere will tell you otherwise)</p>
<p>Consequently, the strangest aspect of this whole pitch was Simmons struggling through his own agendas while telling us why we should buy the Quarterly like he is <strong>Chris Farley</strong> in <em>Tommy Boy. </em>His own trepidation of sounding like an infomercial on NESN is palpable. (Had to get that dig in there)</p>
<blockquote><p>Your default mechanism might be &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of money&#8221; or &#8220;Why would I pay for stuff I already read?&#8221; Believe me, I get it — I hate making people pay for content. Actually, I hate making people pay for <em>anything</em>. Once upon a time, I was creditors-chasing-me-down-for-outstanding-bills-from-two-years-ago broke. I remember being 30 years old and still looking forward to Papa Gino&#8217;s &#8220;All You Can Eat Pizza&#8221; night for $5.99 (I think it was Tuesdays) and thinking, <em>I graduated from college eight years ago, there&#8217;s something totally wrong with this picture.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen Simmons struggle with himself. He tries to see the illogical point of view in this purchase through the eyes of the former version of himself (the bartender &#8211; living paycheck to paycheck ). But once you reach a point of success, part of you changes by nature. Simmons isn&#8217;t in Cambridge watching <em>90210 </em>re-runs anymore. He is the guy who accidentally broke the <strong>Randy Moss</strong> trade via Twitter last year and has made a kajillion dollars off <strong>Ralph Macchio</strong> references.</p>
<h2>Quick Musings</h2>
<p>1.) 12:30 pm last Friday, an hour before the early season showdown between the Bruins and Red Wings, NESN showed a re-run of <em>NESN Daily. </em>CSNNE countered with a pre-game show featuring the usual suspects. The game was nationally televised on NBC (who obviously work in conjunction with CSNNE), and CSNNE had immediate post-game analysis.</p>
<p>NESN had a breakdown of the action at 10 pm that night, nearly 6 hours after the game was over. I&#8217;m telling you, it&#8217;s one thing to avoid teams you don&#8217;t broadcast (although, I still think that&#8217;s reprehensible) but NESN is teetering a line with their Bruins coverage that I wouldn&#8217;t venture.</p>
<p>2.) I do, on the other hand, enjoy <strong>Dale Arnold</strong> leading the pre/post game shows on NESN. He&#8217;s landed nicely.</p>
<p>3.) I refuse to talk about <strong>Heidi Watney&#8217;s</strong> appearance on &#8220;Dennis &amp; Callahan&#8221; yesterday. As one prominent media member told me, &#8220;Her exit has gotten more play than <strong>Jonathan Papelbon</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>4.) Saw <strong>David Portnoy</strong>, El Presidente of Barstool Sports, talk at Northeastern the other night. I asked him if he regretted <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/08/13/sports-media-musings-weei-bans-david-portnoy-barstool-sports-brady-baby-fallout/" target="_blank">&#8220;Baby-Gate&#8221;</a> and &#8211; as always &#8211; Portnoy delivered his, &#8220;No, I look back and I still think that was a funny post.&#8221; Also after he conceded he&#8217;s older and sees his role posting lewd material diminishing, Portnoy quipped, &#8220;I&#8217;ll always be El Presidente!&#8221;</p>
<p>Say what you want, and I&#8217;ve said plenty, Portnoy is extremely successful. He admitted much of the business side of Barstool is &#8220;ass-backwards,&#8221; and is not sure how to deal with logistics of sophisticated financial dealings (like giving others equity). HOWEVER, the guy is<a href="http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/david-portnoy-net-worth/" target="_blank"> worth $2 million</a> and understands the street side of business (brand promotion, staying true to your audience, etc).</p>
<p>5.) Speaking of Portnoy, El Presidente took a nice jab at NESN&#8217;s <strong>Michael Hurley</strong> for<a href="http://www.nesn.com/2011/11/tom-brady-makes-young-eagles-fan-cry-because-quarterback-is-idiot-throws-too-many-touchdowns.html" target="_blank"> &#8216;stealing&#8217; a Barstool post</a>. He even went to said-post and commented, &#8220;Where have I seen this?&#8221;</p>
<p>My first thought was, &#8220;Well it&#8217;s the Internet, and this sort of content cycles and isn&#8217;t really owned by Barstool. Even if Hurley DID get it from BSS, it&#8217;s not really stealing.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><s></s><s>@</s><strong>nesnmhurley</strong> when you just post our exact post 5 seconds after we do we get inundated with people slamming you. Keep it clean brah</p></blockquote>
<p>My next thought was, &#8220;People actually read NESN.com?&#8221;</p>

Here is some reaction to the end of the lockout and 20 thoughts entering the shortened season&#8230;<span id="more-173"></span></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>We want OD-EN! We want OD-EN!</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s what they were all cheering at The Greatest Bar, just across the street from the Gahhhhden&#8230;.</p>
<p>This was four years ago, of course. Entering the &#8217;07 Draft, which (at the time) was a moribund event for Celtics nation. The bouncey balls gave us Jeff Green (which turned into Ray Allen) instead of Greg Oden (Thank God) or Kevin Durant (and his backpack).</p>
<p>Since that disappointment, the Celtics have won a championship and came minutes away from a second. The team collectively appears to be on the wrong side of the hill, and is in need of a big roster move to inject hope. Either way, I&#8217;m excited for their last stand.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, the NBA being back makes me jacked-up like Ray Liotta during the last 45 minutes of <em>GoodFellas </em>(sans the drugs, obviously)<em>. </em>For me, the lockout actually <em>increases </em>my enthusiasm for the season.<!--more--></p>
<p>Think about it: In the next month, weird bargain/reclamation guys like Oden will be available and being signed like a Sony flat screen bought in haste during a &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; sale.</p>
<p>With the season rapidly approaching, many questions have to be asked..</p>
<p>How fast are teams going to implement new free-agents?</p>
<p>What about the learning curve for rookies?</p>
<p>And how will the lockout stunt the growth of brewing talent?</p>
<p>Do you feel like you&#8217;ve heard these questions before? Well that&#8217;s because the same thing happened following the NFL lookout, which made the league the sh!tshow it is today (See Tebow, Tim).</p>
<p>If this lockout has reaffirmed anything, it is how much being a fan of any sport has become knowing not only what happens in between the lines but much more. Components such as business decisions, transactions, and public relations all matter now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not only excited for the games,<em> </em>I&#8217;m excited for the intangibles. The little things, you can&#8217;t ignore.</p>
<p>Here are 20 items I&#8217;m pumped about as we propel toward opening day on Christmas..</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>1. I&#8217;m excited for Greg Dickerson to piss Green and tell me that regular season basketball, uhh, matters.</p>
<p>2. I&#8217;m excited to pretend the C&#8217;s have celebrity fans like the Lakers. This (most notably) includes pretending Donnie Wahlberg qualifies as a <strong>real </strong>celebrity and isn&#8217;t the same Donnie Wahlberg playing a character on <em>Blue Bloods, The Saw </em>franchise<em>, </em>or doing reunion tours with New Kids on the Block.</p>
<p>(Worth stating: Maria Menounos is carrying a dimly lit torch, fighting the good fight, aggressively agreeing as I type this.)</p>
<p>3. I&#8217;m excited for Bob Ryan&#8217;s assessment of the Celtics. He&#8217;s one of the greatest basketball minds in the country, and won&#8217;t be pitching 97 mph much longer. The Celtics, in an odd way, are much like Ryan. I&#8217;m excited for both beyond this season, but slowly will turn appreciative of the tenures rather then compelled.</p>
<p>4. I&#8217;m excited for Mike Gorman to carry Tommy Heinsohn through a back-to-back-to-back 3 game stretch in February. By the way, Tommy has been at that &#8216;appreciative point&#8217; I was talking about with Ryan/Celtics for roughly 5 years now. We all chose to look the other way.</p>
<p>5. I&#8217;m excited for Donny Marshall to get more reps as the color guy.</p>
<p>6. I&#8217;m excited about the first &#8220;Did you know Avery Bradley was actually more highly recruited out of high school than John Wall?&#8221; proclamation.</p>
<p>7. I&#8217;m more excited to reply, &#8221; Did you know Tee Martin was drafted ahead of Tom Brady?&#8221;</p>
<p>8. I&#8217;m excited to see Rajon Rondo take on all the other great point guards the league currently has to offer like CP3, D. Rose, Westbrook, Deron Williams, and John Wall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited for Rondo to become the alpha-dog on the team and solidifying the verbification of his last name..</p>
<p>*I know, you&#8217;re right, that DOES not make sense. <em>Verb-Ify </em>is in FACT not a real word. Basically, it&#8217;s when an athlete or celebrity name becomes a verb.</p>
<p>*The first time I used the term was with <em>American Idol </em>super-der-star!!, Chris Daughtry and &#8220;Daughtificate.&#8221;</p>
<p>*The term, for the record, is when an artist/band&#8217;s entire catalog sound like one long track. Other artists, besides Daughtry, include: 90&#8217;s Boy Bands, Drake [his monotone voice, I believe, contributes to his inclusion], Chicago, among many others. This is much like how we can&#8217;t tell the difference between pass interference and good coverage in the NFL.</p>
<p>Other great <em>Verb-ify </em>examples include..</p>
<p><strong>          Rondo&#8217;D</strong> &#8211; Making a fool out of someone, showing them up.</p>
<p><strong>          Farve&#8217;D </strong>&#8211; Sexting</p>
<p><strong>          Tebow&#8217;D &#8211;</strong> Well, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkpOIggNv7A" target="_blank">you know.</a></p>
<p><strong>          Kardashian&#8217;D &#8211;</strong> Formerly &#8220;Gold-Digger&#8221;, using marriage for monetary purposes</p>
<p>Moving on&#8230;</p>
<p>9. I&#8217;m excited for more &#8220;Urkel Glasses.&#8221; Possibly the most inexplicable fashion trend of the past 25 years.</p>
<p>10. I&#8217;m excited to not see any more &#8220;classic&#8221; Celtics games being played on CSNNE because of the lockout.</p>
<p>11. I&#8217;m excited to see Jackie MacMullan (hopefully) get more time on CSNNE programming.</p>
<p>12. I&#8217;m excited to watch Michael Felger try to take the Bruins momentum with his <em>Sticks &amp; Stones </em>show and upstage Michael Holley&#8217;s <em>Celtics Now </em>program as well as game coverage of the Celtics, featuring Gary Tanguay &amp; the gang.</p>
<p>13. On a national scale, I&#8217;m excited for Shaq &amp; Sir Chaz to spar &#8212; and Kenny The Jet &amp; C-Webb drop the occasional, &#8220;No you didn&#8217;t!&#8221;, like hype men in rap videos. TNT on Thursday nights could become appointment television.</p>
<p>14. I&#8217;m excited to watch the Miami Heat figure it out during the regular season, but still have the same lingering questions the Patriots are facing about playoff shortcomings.</p>
<p>15. I&#8217;m excited for Blake Griffin to try to usurp Kobe &amp; the Lakers as L.A.&#8217;s most interesting team.</p>
<p>16. I&#8217;m (more) excited for Heidi Watney to have an alleged affair with Pau Gasol. (To soon?)</p>
<p>17. I&#8217;m excited for Carmelo Anthony to dog it in New York, but show up in the big games (like when the Knicks play the Heat).</p>
<p>18. I&#8217;m excited for the Dwight Howard trade talks to fire up and completely handcuff the Magic franchise (since he&#8217;s leaving soon and Orlando might as well get market value for him now).</p>
<p>19. I&#8217;m excited for Kyrie Irving&#8217;s career arc to resemble Kenny Anderson. He will suck at first mainly because of unrealistic expectations then &#8211; after 8 years being a journeyman &#8211; Irving will settle into a dependable starter (like Anderson was with the Celtics towards the end of his career).</p>
<p>20. Possibly, the most exciting/hyperbolic aspect of the lockout is (surprisingly) the backlash spawning for its <strong>conclusion</strong>.</p>
<p>The media wants you to feel like David Stern got his wish &#8212; opening the season with a triple-header on Christmas. Yes, the Christmas games will rate well. And, yes, it is a bit concerning the league clearly pushed for this date, knowing dollars were at stake and they could capitalize with the hackneyed, &#8220;What better Christmas gift then the NBA back in your livingroom!?!?&#8221;</p>
<p>All points. All taken. The Bottom Line is ALWAYS $$$.</p>
<p>But do you really think Stern wanted a lock out after coming off last season? He wanted all the momentum gained from the the influx of talent put to a halt?</p>
<p>So many good story-lines (some laid out above) and the product is vastly improved  from the previous &#8220;Me-Me-Me First&#8221; Era..</p>
<p>(Where team basketball was completely abandoned. This was headlined by guys like Rasheed Wallace, Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson &#8212; also known as the &#8220;Post-Jordan, Oh-Crap We Don&#8217;t Have Any Likable Stars&#8221; Era.)</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Even if I do travel down that road, I&#8217;d still have to ponder &#8212; &#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t we scold the NFL for using 9/11 as a buffer of, &#8216;WE CAN&#8217;T BE LOCKED OUT DURING THE TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY&#8217;?&#8221; Seems disingenuous to avoid the point in one circumstance and not the other.</p>
<p>Look, I don&#8217;t care if the players and owners heard Mariah Carey&#8217;s &#8220;All I Want For Christmas Is You&#8221; and thought, &#8220;Oh crap! It&#8217;s almost Christmas time and we aren&#8217;t close to a deal!&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s what induced progressive discussion, fine.</p>
<p>Bob Ryan was right when he wrote, &#8220;The NBA players need to realize there is only one sport this country can&#8217;t live without, and it&#8217;s not theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have <em>really</em> cared if the season was cancelled. Well, beyond asking the predictable &#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; type-questions like I was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI" target="_blank">&#8220;Double-Rainbow&#8221; </a>Guy. And I don&#8217;t mind that a lot of people are indifferent about the league.</p>
<p>However, I do mind people aggressively chastising the fans who are excited for the 66-game sprint-of-a-season. Since when did the NBA become soccer? I have to defend the league&#8217;s existence? This isn&#8217;t a guilty pleasure like admitting to enjoying <em>Entourage. </em>It&#8217;s the NBA, <em>I&#8217;m excited.</em></p>

Lots to catch up on&#8230;<span id="more-147"></span></p>
<p>So without further adieu&#8230;Time for an Infomercial&#8230;big time..</p>
<p><a href="http://point-taken.sportsofboston.com/" target="_blank">Check out the new diggs</a>. It is still EXTREMELY naked, and has plenty of bugs to be worked out.</p>
<p>The site is basically a place for me to react (500 words at a time) to petty stuff like<a href="http://point-taken.sportsofboston.com/2011/11/16/gary-tanguay-earned-a-gold-star-tells-you-about-it/" target="_blank"><strong> Gary Tanguay</strong> doing Gary Tanguay things</a> and the <a href="http://point-taken.sportsofboston.com/2011/11/17/ordway-jabs-at-gresh-zolak-feels-served/" target="_blank"><strong>Andy Gresh/Glenn Ordway</strong> tiff.</a></p>
<p>Normally, I won&#8217;t link up stuff of that nature here &#8212; unless it&#8217;s really warranted.</p>
<p>However I will, occasionally, write in the longer form such as my media <a href="http://point-taken.sportsofboston.com/2011/11/17/winners-losers-media-coverage-of-psu-scandal/" target="_blank">&#8220;Winners &amp; Losers&#8221; column</a> in the PSU scandal &#8212; which I will direct readers of Sports Media Musings to.</p>
<p>Lastly, I had a great chat with <strong>Greg Bedard</strong> from the Globe <a href="http://point-taken.sportsofboston.com/2011/11/18/p-t-podcast-greg-bedard-of-the-boston-globe-on-nfl-new-media/" target="_blank">on my podcast</a>. Really liked his straightforward attitude towards covering the team and takes on new media.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold">Say Goodbye to Hollywood</span></p>
<p><strong>Heidi Watney</strong> leaving NESN is something I&#8217;ve been writing about for months &#8212; it was a terribly kept secret, but you don&#8217;t care about that. You care about what it <em>means. </em>Unfortunately, beyond what may be remembered as a salacious stint as a NESN side line reporter, the answer is not much.</p>
<p>Watney&#8217;s exit to stage left (literally, she&#8217;s reportedly moving to LaLa Land to cover the LakeShow) was covered like an actual trade of a player (you know? the subjects she covers). And why? This wasn&#8217;t <strong>Bob Ryan</strong> leaving the Globe. She was here for four years. It was <strong>Adalius Thomas</strong> leaving the Patriots.</p>
<p>Does the local media feel as though they owe it to her, because &#8211; you know as well as I do &#8211; they most likely talked trash about her lack of objectivity (coming from NESN) and, moreover, the alleged <strong>Jason Varitek</strong> affair?</p>
<p>The coverage reminded me of euphemisms society feels obligated to convey when a celebrity dies (a la, <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> or <strong>Al Davis</strong>), even though we mocked or criticized said-celebrity while they were alive.</p>
<p>Give it time.</p>
<p>Personally, I had no issues with Watney. I wouldn&#8217;t call her a hardened journalist. Nor does she try to operate under that pretense.</p>
<p>Beyond the obvious aesthetics, Heidi wasn&#8217;t bringing much to the table. Marc Bertrand never led a headline with, &#8220;Heidi Watney is reporting at this hour that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Watney never wanted to be <strong>Michelle Tafoya</strong>. In the same light, Watney knew well enough to not be <strong>Lisa Guerrero</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give her this, she mattered in a job mostly perceived as thankless. Though, let&#8217;s be honest, no one with <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?q=heidi+watney+twitter&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;sa=N&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1006&amp;bih=633&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=vnxnEC2GbUaYrM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://twitter.com/HeidiWatney/status/73746026917404672&amp;docid=Rkx2nfjn7QAkNM&amp;imgurl=http://a1.twimg.com/profile_images/1338161333/image_bigger.jpg&amp;w=73&amp;h=73&amp;ei=doDGTrf3LKnl0QHwvqEg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=232&amp;vpy=212&amp;dur=242&amp;hovh=70&amp;hovw=70&amp;tx=62&amp;ty=25&amp;sig=113069840328348608278&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=70&amp;tbnw=70&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=15&amp;ved=1t:429,r:1,s:0" target="_blank">this avatar on Twitter</a> (looks like a modeling headshot) <em>really </em>cares about being an arduous reporter.</p>
<p>(Cue the &#8220;Ryan, you&#8217;re wearing a sombrero in the header of your new site&#8221; joke)</p>
<p>As far as the actual move, Watney in Hollywood is like <strong>Jack Nicholson</strong> doing a Cialis commercial: For both parties (Nicholson &amp; Cialis) it makes so much sense, but you feel bad for Nicholson.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll feel bad for Watney when either: A.) <strong>Metta World Peace</strong> (aka <strong>Ron Artest</strong> &#8212; that&#8217;s always fun typing) scares the sh!t out of her &#8212; OR &#8212; B.) Her first story-arc on <em>Days of Our Lives </em>flops.</p>
<p>Oh, and as far as NESN goes, <strong>STEPPING STONE! STEEPING STONE!! STEPPPPPPPINNNNGGG STONNNNNEEEE!!!!</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already written at length about that after<a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/08/12/sports-media-musings-nesn-loses-mccarthy-tappen-csnne-thriving/" target="_blank"> Jade &amp; Katie Tapps left. </a></p>
<h2>Without a Hitch</h2>
<p>The &#8220;Felger &amp; Mazz&#8221; simulcast debuted on CSNNE this week. I got to say, I was looking for holes and, ultimately, didn&#8217;t find much to complain about. The studio was modern looking and visually appealing. Additionally, CSNNE producers used solid graphics and appropriate highlights when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Felger&#8217;s</strong> &#8220;Two Year&#8217;s of Abuse In Two Minutes&#8221; segment was done in the same vein and light as <a href="https://sports-of-boston-llc.github.io/sportsofboston.com-archive/2011/07/01/sports-media-musings-congressman-felger-scals-foray-espn-drama/" target="_blank">I painted him while first writing about his mantra</a>.</p>
<p>Quick refresher from the piece &#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>Felger’s success is only matched by the perceived disdain that he himself perpetuates, although that statement is somewhat equivocal. For example, a sound byte often played by 98.5 The Sports Hub is Felger bemoaning “No one likes me enough to give me privileged information”; only he’ll oft say things like, “I have on good word, <strong>Brad Marchand</strong> was told to simmer down on the partying.”</p>
<p>Felger is our own <strong>Skip Bayless</strong>. We love to hate him and feel like we need to shower when we agree with him, yet the difference is – unlike Bayless – we respect his opinion. This is probably due to Felger’s own admission of miscalculated pretenses in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>I still stand by those remarks, even though Felger seems agenda-driven now more than ever (see my PSU &#8220;Winners &amp; Losers&#8221; Column for more on that).</p>
<p>One other thing, <strong>Jermaine Wiggins</strong> wearing a &#8220;Wiggy Wear&#8221; t-shirt is high comedy because of the obvious self-promotion. Though, not as funny as Wiggy and his buddies getting together and someone saying, &#8220;You know what? We should do a clothing line!&#8221;</p>
<p>Would have loved to be in that room.</p>
<h2>Two Other CSNNE Thoughts</h2>
<p>Really looking forward to the &#8220;Thanksgiving&#8221; edition of <em>Sports Tonight. </em>If you missed it in previous years (because you have a life), producers put Tanguay and Felger with two other talking heads at a dinner table full of all the fixins&#8217;!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s predictably awkward and (I&#8217;m pretty sure) last year <strong>Dan Shaughnessy</strong> wanted out after the first segment.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now watched CSNNE&#8217;s re-broadcast of the <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>-63 point playoff game in &#8217;86 twice. I really miss the Celtics, and CSNNE should come up something better to suffice.</p>

Now the duo is congealing at the right time. Ordway feels like Angela Bassett in <span style="text-decoration: underline">How Stella Got Her Groove Back</span>, and is joining in on calling out Andy Gresh&#8230;<span id="more-114"></span></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Andy Gresh <a href="http://point-taken.sportsofboston.com/2011/11/17/winners-losers-media-coverage-of-psu-scandal/#more-48" target="_blank">didn&#8217;t get the magnitude</a> of the Penn State scandal. He was either slow to understand the ramifications of the accusations or, even worse, playing contrarian.</p>
<p>Either way, Dan Shaughnessy gave Gresh forewarning on his specious off-base claim that recently dismissed Penn State coach, Joe Paterno, &#8220;Did what he was supposed to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gresh perpetuated the notion. And look, I&#8217;ll concede, I do my fair-share of Gresh-bashing. When I castigate any media member, part of me feels bad. But with Gresh the adverse feeling settles in as I type. I feel like I&#8217;m doing everyone a favor, and most consumers agree with my thoughts.</p>
<p>Anyway, &#8220;The Big Show&#8221; has done well with their wall-to-wall analysis of this Penn State ordeal. On Monday, Glenn Ordway mentioned something to the effect of some media members having &#8220;blinders&#8221; on in the matter and referenced the &#8220;midday host at the other station.&#8221;</p>
<p>Personally, I think Ordway&#8217;s giving WAYYYY too much credit to Gresh. I don&#8217;t think he was to close to the situation or had &#8220;blinders&#8221; on. I think he&#8217;s a braggart who picked the wrong subject to try to play devil&#8217;s advocate on.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>The next day Scott Zolak &#8211; who was mum last week while Gresh was talking himself into trouble &#8211; angrily quipped how he and his co-host were being discredited because they were from Pennsylvania. Shank, who was on the air with the duo, inquired about Zo&#8217;s angst to which Gresh emphatically said, &#8220;The Pringles guy across the street is trying to CUT US DOWN.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two quick thoughts:</p>
<p>1.) Why is Zolak so fired up now? Did he not hear what crap Gresh was spewing last week? A small blurb on Paterno&#8217;s resume? Technically he did the right thing? Lame it took mention from their adversary to evoke passion on the matter.</p>
<p>2.) Even though it appears this way, I don&#8217;t think Ordway was diminishing the value of Gresh and Zo&#8217;s opinion because of their roots (In fact, I don&#8217;t think Ordway implicated Zolak at all in his insinuation). Therefore, for the duo to claim provincial racism on the matter is puerile and a fallacy.</p>
<p>Maybe I am mis-reading Ordway&#8217;s comments, though.</p>

Who, in the media, adapted and attacked the story from the right angle? Who failed to see beyond the peripheral or their forum at a time when the nation was watching the biggest scandal in the history of college athletics unfold?<span id="more-48"></span></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no getting around this story (even if you want to). The scandal is lewd and evil in the worst way. I don&#8217;t have to tell you that though, and my opinions on the matter aren&#8217;t original&#8230;..</p>
<p>The cover-up reminds me of &#8220;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&#8221; Prominent members of the State College community seemed to have knowledge of Jerry Sandusky&#8217;s sick behaviour, but turned away.</p>
<p>And that is <em>almost</em> as damming as Sandusky&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p>We can scoff, opine, and struggle with our shortfalls as a culture because of this one man&#8217;s wickedness. I&#8217;m game as anyone else to go through this practice. I won&#8217;t use my site as a forum, though. Instead, I want to bang out a &#8220;Winner &amp; Losers&#8221; column of media coverage of the scandal.</p>
<p>(And, yes, I know nobody won in this circumstance &#8212; I&#8217;m as appalled as anyone, believe me.)</p>
<h2>Losers</h2>
<p><strong>Andy Gresh &#8211;</strong>  Locally speaking, Gresh is the biggest loser (No pun intended) in the coverage of the scandal. As far as media members go, I measure someone&#8217;s skill on how well they think on their feet. So much of the dialect on hot topics are well-rehearsed rants these talking heads have been rehearsing hours before it&#8217;s go time. It isn&#8217;t often we get the opportunity to see guys like Gresh when news is breaking and reaction is necessary.</p>
<p>Tuesday after the indictment was released, and as the ordeal intensified, Gresh indulged his audience as to how well he can improvise.</p>
<p>Penn State had just cancelled their weekly press conference with Joe Paterno which (appropriately) caused a media frenzy.</p>
<p>In the midst of the firestorm, Gresh said this scandal would not have an impact on Paterno&#8217;s legacy. <strong>Wrong.  </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>98.5 The Sports Hub&#8217;s midday host went on to say &#8220;Paterno technically did the right thing.&#8221; (more?) <strong>Wrong.</strong></p>
<p>He&#8217;ll deny it now. Mainly because he&#8217;s had the chance to see the backlash. It reminded me of when Gresh thought it was okay to call Red Sox center-fielder, Jacoby Ellsbury, a &#8220;Pussy&#8221; on Twitter. The guy needs a filter.</p>
<p>Dan Shaughnessy, who was on the radio with the boisterous host at the time, warned Gresh, &#8220;You are so wrong.&#8221; Gresh either believed what he was saying, or was playing contrarian with subject matter that did not require a devil&#8217;s advocate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tough day when you misconstrue something so badly that Shank becomes the voice of conventional wisdom in the room.</p>
<p><strong>ESPN &#8211; </strong>When your acting ombudsman, the Poynter Institute, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/poynterreview/post/_/id/168/espn-stumbles-with-penn-state-coverage" target="_blank">annihilates your coverage</a> it&#8217;s a good bet things didn&#8217;t go smoothly.</p>
<p>Basic issues: ESPN didn&#8217;t have the live feed of John Surma&#8217;s press conference announcing the school&#8217;s dismissal of Joe Paterno. I&#8217;ll chop that up to technical issues and give the four-letter network a break.</p>
<p>Other media critics have pointed this out and I will not excuse the overall reactionary coverage. Where were the scoops? Where was the power of ESPN and the presumed sources their reporters have?</p>
<p>ESPN has the resources to be better. There wasn&#8217;t enough urgency.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the most notable tidbit of coverage ESPN brought to the table was Matt Millen breaking down on live television.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tough day when your network&#8217;s journalistic contribution to the biggest college athletics scandal is from Matt Millen.</p>
<p><strong>Peter King &#8211; </strong>It&#8217;s worth saying the &#8220;Monday Morning quarterback&#8221; author delivers the best aggregate view of what happens on a given Sunday for SI.com.</p>
<p>But my friends and I have never understood why he engages critiscm on Twitter like he&#8217;s a YouTube commentator discussing the merits of a Creed song.</p>
<p>King&#8217;s griping of how Paterno was let go over the phone was a micro view of an issue which reverberates strongly because of the alleged crime, and frankly came off as petulant. Odd point to hammer on, and I think we can all agree it is trite and insignificant that Paterno was told over phone.</p>
<p>The news was Paterno is gone &#8212; King missed the boat.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Posnanski &#8211; </strong>Another Sports Illustrated scribe makes my list. Joe Po (A. Does that work?), had an<a href="http://joeposnanski.si.com/2011/11/10/the-end-of-paterno/#more-8533" target="_blank"> interesting blog post</a> that I strongly encourage everyone to check out on how he feels about the Paterno implication in the Sandusky scandal.</p>
<p>Posnanski is writing a book on Paterno and admits there is an inherent conflict of interest at play here, which is applauded (you&#8217;ll NEVER read me scold transparency). But JoePo (B.Yes, it does) loses me in his post when he says..</p>
<blockquote><p>But I will say that I am sickened, absolutely sickened, that some of those people whose lives were fundamentally inspired and galvanized by Joe Paterno have not stepped forward to stand up for him this week, have stood back and allowed him to be painted as an inhuman monster who was only interested in his legacy, even at the cost of the most heinous crimes against children imaginable.</p></blockquote>
<p>So JoePo is now asking &#8211; nevermind, check that &#8211; DEMANDING those who Paterno helped in the past to speak up and support him?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had some great teacher&#8217;s in my lifetime. Some I&#8217;ve known better than others. But, no matter what, if it came out that they were somehow harboring knowledge of child molestation &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t jump to defend their character&#8230;</p>
<p>Posnanski says it himself: He doesn&#8217;t know Paterno, he just knows a whole lot about him.</p>
<p><strong>CBS</strong> &#8211; The network needed something<em>, anything, </em>to combat the Bob Costas/Jerry Sandusky interview. Their investigative sports reporter, Armen Keteyian, landed an interview with Mike McQueary. The exclusive was billed and hyped by CBS (and constituents like 98.5 The Sports Hub) all day on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It lasted 24 seconds.</p>
<p>And, really, nothing substantial was illuminated.</p>
<p>By the way, if you couldn&#8217;t guess, McQueary&#8217;s world is &#8220;crazy&#8221; right now.</p>
<h2>Purgatory</h2>
<p><strong>Michael Felger &amp; Tony Massarotti</strong> &#8211; The top rated afternoon drive program, &#8220;Felger &amp; Mazz&#8221;, dissected the Patriots last-second loss to the New York Giants the Monday after the indictment was released.</p>
<p>I have no large quarrels there.</p>
<p>The following day there should have been far more focus on the Penn State scandal. Instead, Felger spewed his well-researched rant on the lack of experience throughout Bill Belichick&#8217;s staff, which he had alluded to the previous day.</p>
<p>Production should have called an audible and veered content towards the Sandusky scandal.</p>
<p>Here is where I give the duo a pass: When Felger attacks something of this magnitude and nature (by that, I mean there is no gray area and everyone is on the same page), he is endearing. His &#8220;morally bankrupt&#8221; line was a perfect example of acerbic tone coupled with caustic remarks being worthwhile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these days, Felger seems agenda driven rather then anything else.</p>
<p>Tony Massarotti&#8217;s statement, &#8220;This makes me not want to like sports&#8221; only heightened later in the show transforming to, &#8220;This makes me feel bad as a human.&#8221; In my eyes, this perfectly summarized the general feeling this scandal created. Mazz was also right to make sure web producers put the indictment on 98.5 The Sports Hub&#8217;s site.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t taken the time to <em>actually </em>read the document, you should. I could be wrong in saying this, but reading the indictment gave the same feeling of realism of how terrible this <strong>really </strong>was much like watching 9/11 unfold on television conveyed the horror of that tragedy.</p>
<h2>Winners</h2>
<p><strong>Fred Toettcher</strong> &#8211; &#8220;Toucher &amp; Rich&#8221; are generally lumped in with &#8220;zoo radio&#8221;, although they&#8217;ve done their part to rid that stigma and become a balanced sports radio show. Toettcher did well to emphasize how big a story this was the Monday following the scandal, while many of his local peers focussed on the Patriots&#8217; collapse to the Giants.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Dennis &amp; Callahan&#8221; &#8211; </strong>The morning drive radio program attacked a subject that is right in their wheelhouse &#8212; sports mixed with scandal of public officials &#8212; and thrived. Producers obtained great guests throughout the coverage. Second to none was Michael Madden who <a href="http://thebiglead.com/index.php/2011/11/09/mark-madden-wrote-about-the-jerry-sandusky-scandal-in-the-beaver-county-times-in-april/" target="_blank">wrote about the scandal <em><strong>in April. </strong></em></a></p>
<p>Madden, who also is a winner in this coverage, dropped this bomb on WEEI..</p>
<blockquote><p>I can give you rumor and I can give you something else … I think we’re going to hear a more shocking development from 2nd mile Foundation … hold onto your stomachs boys, this is gross … [the rumor is] Jerry Sandusky and 2nd mile were pimping out young boys to rich donors. That is being investigated by two prominent columnists even as I speak … [I also think] youll find out Sandusky was told to retire in exchange for a cover up.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8220;The Big Show&#8221; &#8211; </strong>Michael Holley is at his best when it comes to culture and sport colliding. His sparring partner, Glenn Ordway, directed traffic well while Holley interjected with thoughts on the different angles of this scandal. The <a href="http://www.bostonsportsmedia.com/2011/10/sports-media-musings-bryant-gumbel-shock-value-the-big-lead-impresses-zolak-bolsters-broadcast" target="_blank">&#8220;Bryant Gumbel/David Stern plantation owner&#8221;</a> incident gave the tandem a nice appetizer to work off of, and their chemistry was peaking when it needed to be with the Penn State story. Solid radio.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Costas &#8211; </strong>His interview with Sandusky is still being talked about today. Great re-directs, great re-phrasing &#8212; Bob is pure pro who sometimes is unfairly associated with the arrogance of a Joe Buck (probably because both were largely successful at a young age).</p>
<p><strong>The Patriot News &#8211; </strong><a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6217/6326147000_90efac3766_o.jpg" target="_blank">Pwned.</a></p>

<p>The<del> 98.5 The Sports Hub host</del> and <em>Sports Tonight </em>mainstay predicted Red Sox closer Jon Papelbon would leave Boston. He was right and wanted to make sure he told you so, on Twitter.</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Gary Tanguay" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Gary_Tanguay">@Gary_Tanguay</a> Pap gone. Told ya people. Too bad.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve defended the Tanger at great lengths. I contend he is mis-cast as a talking head, and is better used simply as a host. Take some notes from Tom Caron. Stay your lane, Gary.</p>
<p>This week Tanguay talked in generalities about the NBA lockout on <em>Sports Tonight. </em>This led me to believe he doesn&#8217;t really know the even the minutia of the matter. Saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re close&#8221; is like saying, &#8220;I think Jerry Sandusky is a bad guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you want to get real perspective on the matter, I suggest listening to Bill Simmons&#8217; podcast with <a href="http://www.grantland.com/podcasts" target="_blank">Marc Stein and Rick Bucher</a>. It&#8217;s two hours long (in two parts), but they dissect the situation from nearly every vantage point.</p>

<p>Maybe this is because he brings me back to the glory days when, you know, the Patriots were winning Super Bowls. Maybe it&#8217;s because when he originally jettisoned Foxboro in 2004, he fell off the face of the earth &#8212; then, last year, he re-appeared like an old CD you once loved in your teenage years. Maybe it&#8217;s his incessant use of &#8220;Bruh&#8221; (which I&#8217;m assuming means &#8220;Bro&#8221;) on Twitter. Maybe it is because even though the dude has clearly lost a step, as fans, we can tell Branch gives a crap.  Or, maybe, it is because his dreads are fannnnntassttiiccc.</p>
<p>Regardless, I got a kick out of him killing Fireman Ed on Sunday night. I also enjoyed Wes Welker&#8217;s &#8220;Efffffffff Yaaaa &#8212; P &#8211; A &#8211; T &#8211; S !! Pats! Pats! Patssss!!&#8221; facial expression..</p>
<p>So, when my buddy sent a video over, naturally I had to put it up..</p>
